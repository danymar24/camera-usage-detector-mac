# CameraUsage
A small little app that monitors the activation state of your Mac's webcam and triggers HTTP(S) requests.

This is a simple app that is designed to send a HTTP request to a URL wehen the usage state of the computer's webcam changes.

Adapted to send the camera status as "In_Meeting" or "Available" to work with NodeRED [OnAirSign](https://github.com/danymar24/on_air_sign)
